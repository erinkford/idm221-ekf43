            <p>My name is Erin Ford, I am a Graphic Designer studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia.
            I do freelance graphic design work for websites, advertising, and social media campaigns. I am based in the Philadelphia/New Jersey
            area. I graduated high school in 2022 and am currently securing an undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in Graphic Design at 
            Drexel Universitys Westphal School of the Arts. From a young age, I have had a huge passion for creating. Whether it was painting, 
            sculpting, making a craft, or even dancing, I loved any opportunity I could get to use my creative abilities. I have a fine arts 
            background, specifically in oil painting and drawing. I began transferring my creativity into the digital world in my senior year 
            of high school, when I was offered a job to create content for a non-profit organization called ReDefy.  I have also done 
            several art commissions including portraits, maps, and large sized house paintings. In the summer of 2020, I was accepted into a 
            scholarship program with Kode With Klossy, a coding camp for girls run by supermodel Karlie Kloss.</p>
