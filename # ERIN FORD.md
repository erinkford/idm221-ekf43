## Hi, I'm Erin,

My name is Erin Ford, I am a Graphic Designer studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia. I do freelance graphic design work for websites, advertising, and social media campaigns.
I am based in Princeton, New Jersey where I grew up. I graduated high school in 2022 and am currently securing an undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in Graphic Design at Drexel Univer- sity’s Westphal School of the Arts. From a young age, I have had a huge passion for creating. Whether it was painting, sculpting, making a craft, or even dancing, I loved any opportunity I could get to use my creative abilities. I have a fine arts background, specifically in oil painting and drawing. I began transferring my creativity into the digital world in my senior year of high school, when I was offered a job to create content for an organization called ReDefy’s social media page. I have also done several art commissions including portraits, maps, and large sized house paintings. In the summer of 2020, I was accepted into a scholar- ship program with Kode With Klossy, a coding camp for girls run by supermodel Karlie Kloss.

## The Arco Floor Lamp Poster Design

The process began with sketches of the form itself, attempting to capture the solid and stable nature of the structure. The concept that I originally had thought of when creating my design originated from what I read on the history of the lamp. I learned that the intention behind the creation was to provide overhead lighting that was mobile and robust. 

The most important aspect of the lamp then stood out to me, the curved connecting bar that reaches out and creates a circular motion. I began conceptualizing how I could repeat the lamp in a way that emphasizes this feature, and highlight the reach of the lamp’s light source. I also made an effort to display the importance of the curve through juxtaposing the form to the type
