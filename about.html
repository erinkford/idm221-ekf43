          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <h5>Graphic Designer <span>UXID Designer</span></h5>
          <p>With my extensive background in fine arts; whether it is painting, drawing, sculpting, or printmaking, I am passionate about always finding novel ways to express my creative visions. During my high school years, I was a graphic designer for an international teen non-profit organization Redefy, working with the media team to design and to curate social media posts aimed at defying stereotypes. In the summer of 2020, I was the recipient of a full scholarship to Kode with Klossy, an all-girls summer coding intensive camp in New York City. At the coding camp, I felt empowered and energized to be around so many young women from across the US who were interested in coding and web development, while also being creative thinkers like myself. The experiences gained from my role at Redefy and participating in the Kode with Klossy camp sparked my desire to pursue my higher education in graphic design and in web design. I am currently in my junior year studying towards a BS degree in Graphic Design and User Experience Interaction Design at Westphal College of Media arts and Design at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. My goals as a designer are to be able to bring my unique creative process into the world, and to develop user experiences that reflect a strong company and brand system. </p>
